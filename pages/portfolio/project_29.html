            <h5>Roomkey.com Homepage Re-design</h5>
            <article class="smallFontBy08">
                <p>Roomkey.com, online hotel booking, was switching over to a responsive framework. Part of that project included the resdesing of the company's homepage. I worked with Room Key to create a design that would easier to use than the original and create marketing space to accomodate the companies needs.</p>

<p>The resulting design is can accomodate mobile and tablet states, has ample marketing space and strongly emphasises the search function.</p>
