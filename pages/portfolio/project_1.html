                    This project was it blog design for a very talented  local chef and food stylist. She wanted to re-create the look of chalkboard menu drawings that many restaurants use. Just like the menu changes constantly a blog is constantly adding content so the blackboard theme really fits.</p>

<p>The goal was to also have the site ticket backseat the great photography and writing of the site. Therefore the design is really minimal.</p>

<p>This site was done on WordPress.</p>
