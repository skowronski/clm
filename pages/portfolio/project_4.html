            <article class="smallFontBy08">
                <p>This project was the design of website for 1814 Magazine, a quarterly publication featuring the works of prominent fashion photographers. Like the magazine, the client wanted the site to be a vessel to showcase the photography and not distract from it.</p>
                    <p>The starkness of the site matches the magazine and has an almost gallery like feel.</p>
                    <p>As the site grows I am helping keep this feeling yet accomplish new goals like selling the magazine onsite, supporting contests and attracting advertisers.</p>
