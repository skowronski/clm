                <p>This is a website redesign for MRK financial. They had a website that was starting to look dated and they wanted something to represented them better.</p>

<p>I updated the colors the company used and refreshed their branding. The client wanted to focus on the fact that they are a Minnesota company I accomplished this using imagery featuring local lakes and scenes from the region.</p>

<p>The website matches looking feel of new print material which I also designed.</p>
