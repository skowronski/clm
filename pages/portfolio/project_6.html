            <article class="smallFontBy08">
                <p>BAG Corp is an industrial manufacturing company that has benefited from some really great branding. I was able to pull from this to create a really exciting site for what could been a really dry subject.</p>
                
                <p>The clients products are highly technical and their audience is there to see the data. So information was king in this site design. Displaying the information and in a digestible manner as well as organizing the products were the major hurdles.</p>
                
                <p>The resulting site really showcases everything in a way that is easy to read, looks great and still has all of the details needed to relay the technical aspects of the product lines.</p>
