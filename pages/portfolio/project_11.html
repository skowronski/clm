                <p> This was a logo design project for light bulb manufacturer. The new company was new but wanted the name, look and feel to be like an older company. </p>  <p>Precision Lighting and Transformer is kind of wordy and the logo needed to work in a variety of applications including being printed on lightbulbs. I ultimately created multiple versions to address the multiple applications. </p>
