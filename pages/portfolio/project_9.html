                <p>This website was designed as a means to showcase and book lawyers for speaking engagements. </p>
				<p>On top of that is a commerce aspect of the site to sell books at this because it written A blog was integrated into the site to keep viewers informed and updated about the speakers </p>
                   
                   <p>I used Drupal to create the CMS for the site. The client needed to input the speaker, their bio, audio & video as well as their products. All this had to be searchable and navigated by the users. </p>
